# NYC DOE Per Session Automation
*AI-assisted Google Apps Scripts for uniform job posting*

| Script | Purpose | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| [`job-posting-request-form_creator.js`](job-posting-request-form_creator.js) | Auto-generates Google Form from parameters | Standardized 50+ central office requests |
| [`response-reader-docx_creator.js`](response-reader-docx_creator.js) | Converts form responses → Docx job postings | Cut batch processing from 25 mins → 3 min |

**Tech**: Google Apps Script (JavaScript), Forms/Sheets/Docs API, AI-prompted (Grok/Perplexity) → human-tested and quality-controlled
**Built as internal prototypes** — ready for deployment.

*Commit history shows iteration. Open to feedback.*
